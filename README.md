# Saved Reddit Interface

Website: https://reddit-saved-app.herokuapp.com

This tool is for Reddit user's to see all of their saved posts or comments all at once. This was meant to solve the problem of manually scrolling through ~25 items at a time and having lots of useless clutter. In addition to viewing your post/comments there is the ability to unsave them directly from this app.

## Install Locally

If you don't trust the website and/or want to mess with things locally, please feel free to clone the repo! The following steps will show how to make a Reddit authorized application and how to add its credentials to a config file.

Please clone 'Master' and navigate to it

```
git clone git@github.com:hippohipporhino/SavedRedditInterface.git
cd SavedRedditInterface
```

Create a config.js file with your Reddit App details

```
TODO
```

## Branches

the 'Heroku' branch is what is currently on the website hosted by Heroku. It is redeployed after new commits are pushed to 'Heroku'.
the 'Master' branch is what should be downloaded if someone wants the code since it is missing the Heroku environment variables.
